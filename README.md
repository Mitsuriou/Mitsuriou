- üìö I might no be the best in any technology, I am very versatile. Therefore, I can create a project from A to Z by myself, including backend (server / database), APIs and frontend. Also, I have an unlimited thirst for knowledge! I love learning new stuff!

- üì± I would like to concentrate my effort in mobile applications creation during 2022, to be able to provide profesional quality apps. I will try to think about UI and UX as much as possible at the same time.

- üéÆ I used to be a geek when I was a little bit younger. My favorite game of all time? "NieR: Automata", without hesitation! This game is trully a masterpiece, it has an amazing story.
